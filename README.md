<h1>An ALNS Framework for EVSP</h1>

This project provides an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search framework for (single depot) electric vehicle scheduling problem (EVSP). The package requirements, data structure and details of algorithm design will be introduced below. An simple example will help you better understand how to use the framework to solve EVSP and extend it by designing your own destroy and repair operators.
